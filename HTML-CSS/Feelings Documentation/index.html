        <p>Welcome to the first technical documentation page created by Elijah Hernandez.</p>
        <p>This page will be an abstract walkthrough of how to manage and accept your feelings, even when they seem to
          manage you. We will cover emotions like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sadness</li>
          <li>Anger</li>
          <li>Envy</li>
          <li>Disgust</li>
          <li>Joy</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Knowing how to identify your feelings is the first step towards any resolution in feelings.</p>
        <p>A failure to properly identify these feelings can result in depression, anxiety, and other emotional issues
          which can control your happiness and wellbeing. </p>

        <p>Once your feelings have been identified, you can work to understand their roots. Emotions are triggered by
          memories, sensations, and other feelings.</p>
        <p>Like a tree branch to the root, you have to start with how you are feeling, and work down to understand why.
          Many people conflate this process with having "emotional intelligence," but observing our feelings is not a
          formally taught process. To understand feelings, you must ask yourself questions that relate to your feelings:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Where did this feeling come from?</li>
          <li>How long has this feeling been here?</li>
          <li>What other feelings do I have?</li>
          <li>Why did this feeling occur?</li>
        </ul>

      <article>
        <p>The answers to these questions are sometimes difficult to obtain. We often have to reframe the way we think
          about seeking joy, as it is an emotion like anything else, and not a concrete goal we can strive towards.</p>
        <p>To increase our happiness, our goal cannot be to "simply be more happy." We must increase the number of
          things in our lives which bring joy. This involves understanding yourself and your strengths, and learning to
          challenge yourself to be outside of your comfort zone.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>Exit your comfort zone.</code>
          </li>
          <li><code>Your environment must be a product of you.</code></li>
          <li><code>Understand your flaws.</code></li>
          <li><code>Embrace the unordinary.</code></li>
          <li><code>Remember your roots.</code></li>
          <ul>

        <p>Once you have identified and accepted your feelings, you can manage them as you see fit. The word
          "management" has a bad reputation because it may be perceived as trying to control natural and ordinary
          feelings which arise. In this context, emotional management means observing your emotions to better understand
          how they are rooted in you.</p>
        <p>For example, if I feel happy waking up in the morning, I might ask myself what is making me happy this
          morning. Is it the smell of breakfast wafting in from the kitchen? Or is it the excitement of a long, busy day
          ahead? Perhaps, even a bit of anxiety? Understanding your emotions as a whole helps you paint a picture about
          who you are and lights your path to real happiness.</p>
