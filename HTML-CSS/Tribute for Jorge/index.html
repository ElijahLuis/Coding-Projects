        <blockquote><p>"We little knew that afternoon, God was going to call your name.</br>In life we loved you dearly, in death we do the same.</br>It broke our hearts to lose you, you did not go alone,</br>For part of us went with you the day God called you home.</br>You left us beautiful memories, your love is still our guide,</br>And though we cannot see you, you are always by our side.</br>Our family chain is broken and nothing seems the same.</br>But as God calls us one by one, the chain will link again."</p>
